## Hey, I'm Jethro. 👋

I am a full-stack PHP developer currently living and working in sunny South Africa. 

My go-to technologies include [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) but I am also a firm believer in keeping it simple, utilizing regular HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as much as possible. 

In my free time, I’m working on [jethromay.com](https://jethromay.com), where I write tech-related tutorials on various topics. When I am not working on that, I am upskilling myself.

For casual questions its best to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/may_jethro) otherwise you can email me at <hello@jethromay.com>.
